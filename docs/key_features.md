TODO 
generate a dataset that has the following features 
- individual FE
- two treatment effects: a "good" treatment and an "ok" treatment (and a control)
- groups: for old people the good treatment is 2x better, for young people, the good and ok are ~ the same 

this lets us illustrate
    1) event & compare (i.e. DiD)
    2) heterogeneity (old/young people get diff. treatment effects)
